# Animal Detection System

## Overview
The Animal Detection System is a software application designed to detect and classify animals in images or video streams. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, it aims to accurately identify various types of animals, providing valuable insights for wildlife monitoring, conservation efforts, and research purposes.

## Features
- **Object Detection**: The system employs state-of-the-art object detection techniques to locate animals within images or video frames.
- **Classification**: Once animals are detected, the system classifies them into predefined categories, such as species or animal types.
- **Accuracy**: The application prioritizes accuracy in detection and classification to ensure reliable results.
- **Real-time Processing**: For video streams, the system can process frames in real-time, enabling continuous monitoring and analysis.
- **Scalability**: The system is designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently, making it suitable for processing extensive image and video datasets.

## Installation
1. **Requirements**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with necessary dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. **Clone Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/animal-detection-system.git
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies using pip.
   ```bash
   cd animal-detection-system
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Configuration**: Modify the configuration file (`config.yaml`) to specify input sources, detection thresholds, and other parameters as needed.
2. **Run Application**: Execute the main script to start the animal detection system.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. **Input**: Provide input images or video streams through specified sources (e.g., webcam, file paths).
4. **Output**: View detection results either directly within the application interface or through generated output files.
